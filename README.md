# Flood-Detection-System-FYP using GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE ( Colour Change Analysis)

# This Project aims to develop a satellite0based flood detection system that leverages historical and current satellite imagery to identify and monitor flood events over time in Cork region.

# Using satellite data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), this system analyses changes in pixel colur and the reflection in satellite images over a time period. By applying image processing techninques and environmental indices like the Normalized Difference Water Index(NDWI), the system is able to identify water bodies and detect abnormal increases in water-covered areas, which may indicate flooding.

# This project focus on two main aspects:
# - Identifying flood events
# - Interactive visualization for end users.
